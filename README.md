I showcased every feature in my presentation. 
The only "hidden" feature I can think of is the alert controller that appears over the guide editor. 
In order for it to appear, you need to click "done" while the picker is selecting the first city (New York). 
I implemented it as a work-around since I couldn't figure out how to correclty update the picker to select the city that you are editing.
