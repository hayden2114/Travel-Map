 a) What is the app:
 
    Create travel guides and post them onto a world map
 
 b) Functional scope:
 
    The browsable, zoomable world map will display city-specific travel guides represented as pins. If a guide has been uploaded for a certain city, a pin will be present on the map for that city. Click a pin to open a city and then select from a list of the guides for that city.

    People who travel to a new city can access personal guides from fellow travelers who have already visited and experienced the city.

If it is feasible, I'd really like to incorporate user login because this app is useful only if multiple people can use it. However, please inform me if building this app to handle multiple users will be too difficult for this projects time restraint. I have no way to judge how difficult it is since we haven't covered that in lecture.
 
 Also, I believe the structure of scope d would allow me to expand the app to scope e with very little re-writing of code, if any. Let me know if you agree!
