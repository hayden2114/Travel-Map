My guide doesn&rsquo;t consist of everything single thing you can do in the city, but what I did and my main recommendations. I only had around 2 &frac12; months in Boston and wanted to spend my time wisely and have a general plan of things I wanted to do while there. That being said &ndash; some of the best experiences I had in Boston (and also travelling outside of it) we&rsquo;re not planned. Have a general plan and be smart with your time but also be SPONTANEOUS&hellip;some of the best experiences I had were the little things you just stumble upon. It is so much fun finding hidden treasures and having random/unplanned days. These are the days that you really really remember and learn so much about yourself. Boston really is such a fun and young city so take advantage of the melting pot of people and also the city as a whole. Meet the people, try everything, and walk around for hours. Boston really has such character that I have yet to find anywhere else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Key Lessons</strong></p><ul><li><u>STEP OUT of your comfort zone</u>- I moved to Boston knowing one person and lived with completely random girls I found on a sublease page and it was the best decision I could of done. It is important to branch out and MEET OTHER PEOPLE.</li><li><u>CHERISH the beauty of living a new city</u>- make sure you appreciate every second of living in a completely different city. Take a step back and take it in- it goes by way too fast</li><li><u>Learn the PEOPLE</u> &ndash; people in the east coast can be different. Make sure you take the time to learn the people. Also people from Boston have a HUGE amount of pride. Make sure you immerse yourself in that</li><li><u>Get LOST on purpose</u> &ndash; this how you stumble upon the hidden gems</li><li><u>Enjoy the JOURNEY not the destination</u> - I met the most incredible people literally on transportation.

If you look to the left facing beach you&rsquo;ll see the shroom bar on the cliff where people chil/do shrooms. I think it&rsquo;s called Kangaroo and Mountain Bar. We chilled on the rock formations right by it, pretty views</li><li>Other things to do - waterslide, jet ski, boat ride, etc. i just didn&rsquo;t do all of this&nbsp;&nbsp;bc i had done a lot in phi phi &amp; was spending more money in ze islands than expected</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hostel</p><ul><li>Nomad Hostel - super fun hostel and good location. Was only a&nbsp;&nbsp;4 night minimum stay but we only have to pay for 3! Not too far from Haad Rin Beach (where full moon party is).&nbsp;</li><li>Other hostels - I don&rsquo;t suggest staying right where full moon party. theres better areas &amp; the beach has more of a Panama city beach vibe.

I suggest going to 7/11 before &amp; buying a small bottle of alcohol. i drank that the entire night - the alcohol at the party can get expensive &amp; can sometimes be drugged. Awesome party theres like 11 different areas/stages on beach &amp; you hop around to different music. Stay up all night &amp; watch the sunrise!! there are taxis back to your hostel all night. i took one back with a bunch of ppl at like&nbsp;7am&nbsp;to catch my ferry&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Summary / Other Things to Know&nbsp;</p><ul><li>i LOVED this island so much lol, bc it had a little of everything &amp; is more of the balance of adventuring &amp; partying. Obviously its known for full moon but there is so much to see on the island&hellip; its huge! and so much bigger than Phi Phi. You motobike/adventure around day then party at night. Make sure to get to the island a few days before so you can go to the other parties. Also book hostels in advance! most are 5 night minimum stay but i would suggest finding a 3 night minimum stay one</li><li>I never felt unsafe on the island with getting drugged etc. but just make sure you stay with ppl at all times &amp; bring your own alcohol in (cheaper &amp; less likely to get drugged)</li><li>Any have a BLAST at full moon its incredible lol&nbsp;</li></ul>"),

I 100% want to live here at one point in my life, hopefully in my 20s. The city really does have it al - skyscrapers, islands, amazing people, incredible food, and so so much to do. It&rsquo;s pretty much the New york of Asia but BETTER because it has soo many outdoorsy things to do. It is comprised of about 250 surrounding islands with insane hikes and views. It&rsquo;s perfect bc if you want to get away from the city for a little, there are so so many options.&nbsp;</li><li>One of my FAVORITE cities, this is a MUST for people that love big cities but also exploring islands. These are too of my favorite things essentially so i loved it lol. Its honestly the perfect city</li><li>Side Note: Hong Kong is insanely expensive so i don&rsquo;t recommend it if you are on a tight tight budget. I luckily could spend a little more since South East Asia wa sos cheap &amp; i also had a friend who lived here so stayed with him. Also, HK is super confusing getting around.. but bc i had a friend showing me around i never got lost and just followed him lol. Defiantly do your research before going here so you know how to get around. There are literally so many traposrtations systems.. they are hella efficient but very confusing&nbsp;</li><li>This city is also one the most logical cities i have ever experienced. Im not kidding the amount of times i said, wow these people are so logical. Examples-&nbsp;</li><li>Hong Kong is really not part of China.</li></ul>"),
    
    TravelGuide(title: "El Nido, Phillipines", coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 11.209709, longitude: 119.462254), tripTitle: "Asia Grad Trip", startDate: "6/19/17", endDate: "8/04/17", tripOverview: "<p>Getting There/ Overall Summary of The Islands&nbsp;</p><ul><li>There are no direct flights to any of the islands. To get to anywhere in the Phillipines, you have to fly to Manilla (the capitol city) and then take a flight to one of the islands. I do not suggest staying long in Manilla, there isn&rsquo;t much to do and it can be unsafe. Just pass through and hop on a flight to an island, such as El Nido. For EL Nido, there are about 4 flights a day to the island. We flew on a late flight to Manilla then hopped on the&nbsp;6am&nbsp;flight to El Nido. The plane will be one of the smallest you have experienced lol.</li><li>After you land, you can get a tricycle taxi to El Nino Town. It is very cheap - around 150-300 pesos and only about a 15min ride.&nbsp;</li><li>Overall, The Philippines transportation system is very underdeveloped and hopefully they will have direct flights soon. If you want to hop to different islands, there are flights in between where you don&rsquo;t have to fly back to Manilla. There are also ferries. If you want to go to another place such as Coron in Palawan, you can take a ferry/slow boat. If you want to go to another place such as Cebu, there is a direct flight to Cebu&nbsp;</li><li>We decided to just stay in one place in the Philippines and not hop around. I recommend that because getting around is harder&nbsp;</li><li>When you leave in El Nido, you will have to fly to Manilla and then fly to your next destination. How my flights worked is i had to stay in Manilla for the night then take a flight to my next destination the next morning. This was at the end of my 7 weeks of backpacking (&amp; straight hostels for 50 days). I got a good recommendation for a hotel on the plane flying to Manilla so i decided to ball out at a nice airport hotel for my last night in Asia, instead of sleeping in the airport or going to a further away hostel.. bc ya know sometimes you just need to splurge when your broke af by the end of the your trip! I suggest balling da f out at Remington hotel.. it was around 40 dollars for the night but was a 3 star hotel with free shuttle to airport and free breakfast. Side Note they also gave me free toothpaste (i was struggling / running out of stuff at the end of my few weeks) and ya that was really nice of them lol. Also, there is a mall with a bunch of restraints right across the street if you need somewhere to go eat. Finally, if you are concerned about security or safety in Manilla, this hotel had hella security i felt like i was at the airport.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sights/ Things to Do</p><ul><li>Submariner Scuba Certification - If you are interested at all in diving or just want to experience the underwater world I highly recommend scuba diving and getting certified. It is one of the cheapest in the world and was about 350 pesos. It was an absolutely incredible experience. You will spend one day doing theory/written learning (I suggest going to a beach restaurant and sitting there and doing it.). and then the next 2 days diving in the ocean and training. I also recommend one day doing a fun dive where you don&rsquo;t have training and will get to do fun dives the whole day. This is where you really enjoy yourself and our dive master/indstructor was incredible. We also got to know the Submariner crew so well. We loved this experience. Diving is really something so surreal that you need to do. It was the highlly of our Philippines trip and it was incredible getting certified in one of the best diving spots in the world. We saw turtles, stingrays, snappers etc&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Island Tours A, B, C, D - I highly recommend doing a combo tour of Island A &amp; C. you get to see a lot of the islands and even though you spend less time in each place, you get to see a lot more. You also get a traditional Phillipino meal on the boat. Super fresh food and a great experience!&nbsp;</li><li>Nacpan Beach - rent motorbikes and go to Nacpan beach. this is about a 45 min motorbike away and was such a pretty drive going there. We were definitely though not prepared for the bumpy and muddy roads lol..my sister even got her motorbike stuck in the mud and all these 6 years olds were laughing at her it was hilarious. This beach can be a struggle to get too bc of rain and mud but is super nice and gives you a chance to see another beach outside of the main El Nino Town.</li><li>Las Cabanas Sunset - the most unreal sunset i have ever seen. Go here so sunset and explore some of the restraunts/music on the beach. It is a short tricycle right away. There is also a zipline between the beach and island if you are interested in that!&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hostel&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Old Melting Pot Hostel - good hostel, free breakfast, met a good amount of people here&nbsp;</li><li>Oggie Beach Pension - literally right on the beach &amp; my sister and I got a private room here actually for 5 bucks so it was 2.5 per person. incredible location and super nice people&nbsp;&nbsp;(kids lol) running it!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Food / Nightlife&nbsp;</p><ul><li>V and V - good bagels for breakfast&nbsp;</li><li>Habibi - cute little restaurant above Submariner dive center. if you dive with them, you get 10%. dank banana shakes!</li><li>Altrove - amazing pizza. get the truffle!&nbsp;</li><li>Sun Bar- go chill out here at Las Cabanas Beach&nbsp;</li><li>Art Cafe - more fore tourists, has a variety of food, kinilaw (Filipino ceviche), stuffed squid&nbsp;</li><li>Save - chill beach vibes, pillows, more expensive but good for happy hour</li><li>Athena- such good greek food and awesome atmosphere. get a gyro!</li><li>Gusto - i think we got incecream here like 4 times&nbsp;</li><li>Las cabanas beach resort and restaurant - last restaurant on Corong Corong Beach, walk all the way down, more secluded and such a pretty atmosphere. the sky is literally pink one here. we had out last meal here and it was surreal. Got the adobo &amp; it was awesome!&nbsp;</li><li>Food you should try&nbsp;</li><ul><li>Sig Sig (pork lovee and pork ear). Served on hot skillet&nbsp;</li></ul></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Summary / Other Things to Know&nbsp;</p><ul><li>NO VISA&nbsp;</li><li>El Nido was the least touristy place i have ever been and i loved it. i really felt like i got a more cultural feel for the island and even got to know a bunch of locals since we were there for about 9 days.. and got to know the Submariner dive shop well.&nbsp;</li><li>If you are looking for a less touristy place and really would like to get an island vibe, El Nido is the place for you. It is super off the beaten path and I&rsquo;m not kidding the people are actually the nicest in the world.&nbsp;</li><li>But, since it is less tourtisyty, this comes with being very underdeveloped. The island has essentially no wifi, electricity is on and off, there is not too much nightlife yet. It is for more off the beaten path people. Because it is so untouched, it really was one of the most beautiful places in the world. I&rsquo;ll really miss this island</li><li>Tips: the ATM machines on and off work so make sure you exchange some cash in the Manilla airport. Most places don&rsquo;t take credit cards, even the dive shops (they do take pay pal but it most likely will not work).</li></ul>"),

Not expensive- about 30 euros and so worth it. It is a typical/traditional Moroccan massage and was soo nice to have after out dessert excursion</li><li><u>Exploring the Old Medina: </u> look at markets, buy traditional dress, BARGAIN! , whatever they say cut it in half . We did this every night and some during the day and it was sooo much fun the market is AMAZING.<ul><li><u>Jemaa El FNA:</u> musicians, acrobats, and storytellers on this city square, find the snake charmers, monkey- will have to pay for pictures. Fortune tellers, dancing troupe, fruit juice stalls, even a dentists here; Transforms into restaurants stands in the evening and eat the food! &agrave; get lost in here for hours&hellip; I held a monkey, held a snake, got a henna for about 3 euros, and ate a ton of weird food.</li><li><u>Souks Cherifia - </u>there are many branching off Jemma el Fna, where you can buy almost anything</li></ul></li><li><u>DESSERT EXCURSION</u>: Camel Ride and Quad Biking Full Day: <a href='http://www.dunesdeserts.com/en/activity/quad-camel-combo/'>http://www.dunesdeserts.com/en/activity/quad-camel-combo/</a><ul><li>This by far was my favorite thing I did in Morocco and one of my favorite experiences this semester. They pick you up around 8am for the excursion, drive about 30 minutes to the dessert, and set you up with the camels. You ride for about 2 hours in total on the camels with a ton of opportunity to see the dessert and take photos. The local guides are hilarious and made the whole experience so fun. You ride for about an hour, stop for a quick snack/tea break, then ride an hour back to camp. They then set you up with gear for the ATV/quad biking rides and you get to ride for 25 miles (about 2 hours). SOOO much fun and you get to haul ass. We also stopped for lunch in the middle of it and ate traditional tajina and tea with all the local guides. They were so kind and welcomning. Overall &agrave; BEST DAY EVERRR</li></ul></li><li><u>Koutoubia and Kasab Mosque</u>: some of Markaechs most famous symbols, achieved place of worship, non Muslims can not enter but get a view of it, doesn&rsquo;t take long to see, near the markets.</li><li><u>Jardin Majorelle</u>- beautiful botanical garden, world famous gardens owned by Yves Saint Laurent. About a 7 euro entrance feee but 100% worth it. Beautiful gardens with amazing colors .We saw someone get proposed to here!! Only takes about 45 min-1 hr to see everything.</li><li></li></ul><p>Food/ Restaurants</p><ul><li><u>WEIRD food!</u> &ndash; sheep&rsquo;s head, cooked snails, tajine, spices. Try harira (great soup, of lamb/beef, red lentils and vegetables). Don't be afraid &ndash; I tried the lamb head, brain, and snails!! All were great:)</li><li><u>Mint Tea</u>- so GOOD. I drank so much tea this weekend (was free/unlimited at our hostel)</li><li><u>Tajine</u> &ndash; typical Moroccan meal, mountain of vegetables/meat on a huge platter</li><li><u>Restrauunts</u>- we just ate at on cool rooftop restraunts in the Medina area that had awesome views, all were very good, don&rsquo;t remember the exact names. Friend ate at Nomad which is supposed to be very good.</li></ul><p>Night Life</p><ul><li>Didn&rsquo;t go to clubs because we had fun exploring the markets at night. One night we drank at this restraunt/bar right by Le Marakesh (the red lit up restraunt). They had happy hour and the drinks were really good. You really wont find many restraunts in Morocco that provide alcohol so if you wan to drink go to Le Marrakesh which is more pricey or the restraunt to the right of it.</li><li>If you want to go to clubs these are ones I looked into before go to Marrakech that seemed very fun! Also I&rsquo;m sure if you stay at a hostel they will have good recommendations: 555 Famous Club , TheatrO, <u>Le Comptoir-</u> rooftop terrace, oriental shows, restaurant, dj, clubs , <u>Le Palaca Jad Mahal</u>- bar, restaurant</li></ul><p>Accommodation</p><ul><li><u>Riad Rouge Hostel</u> - old mansions, centered on a patio and full of designer touches, retreat from outside world. They are Cheap, beautiful guest houses; best way to go -&gt; Literally looked like straight out of Aladdin! These Riads are in the heart of Marrakech and ours offered superb value for money and a more authentic experience. We paid 6 euros a night and stayed in the tent room on top of the roof top terrace. One of the most amazing experiences and would highly recommend. Got a little chilly at night so snuggle and ask for hella blankets! The hostel people were so nice &ndash; we got free/ unlimited tea and for free they showed us a ton of places to go. They even set us up one night with an affordable dinner place to go. People were staying there from all over the world and it had such a laid back/chill atmosphere. The rooms were all so colorful/ different and sleeping in a tent was one of the most incredible experience. Would literally wake up to the sunrise. Only downfall to the hostel was that the showers were pretty cold lol but regardless STAY HERE we loved it!! <a href='http://www.riadsmorocco.com'>http://www.riadsmorocco.com</a><u>. </u></li></ul><p>Transportation</p><ul><li>Take a taxi from the airport to you accommodation. Make sure the taxi had a metre so you don&rsquo;t get ripped off. We pretty much walked everywhere in Morocco since we were in such a good location (about a 5-10 minute walk from the medina).</li></ul><p>Things I wish I could of done<strong>:</strong></p><ul><li>I SOOO BADLY want to camp out one night in the Saharan Dessert. That was on my list of things to do before even studying abroad but I realize when I got here that is was going to be harder to do in a weekend. It takes a very long time to get out to the Saharan Dessert and camp out there for a night. But if you want to spend a little more time in a car and can find a good company to do it through- DO IT!! We just didn&rsquo;t because it was pricey and we felt like we didn&rsquo;t have as much time. Also wish I could of hiked the Atlas Mountains!. I have a long list of palaces and mosques that we didn&rsquo;t get too and had done some research on them beforehand. In my opinion, what we saw was just enough but here are the names!<ul><li><u>El Badi Palace</u><u> - </u>dates back to the 16th century, when it was constructed as a seat of power and luxury. Go onto terrace! Beautiful views of Atlas Mountains</li><li><u>Tombeaux Saadian</u><strong><em> &ndash; </em></strong>ancient tombs from 16<sup>th</sup> century</li><li><u>Marrakech Ramparts</u>- across from Saadain</li><li><u>Sultans Palace</u>- took about 25 years to build</li><li><u>Bahia Palace</u></li><li><u>Royal Palace of Marakech - </u>complex with a rich history dating back to the 12th century. While visitors unfortunately cannot enter the palace complex itself, its location on the outskirts of the southern Medina and near to El Badi Palace make it a quick and easy stop for visitors to take in the high walls, manicured trees, and gargantuan wooden doors that protectively surround the palace. Cant take photos..</li><li><a href='http://www.mamounia.com/'>La Mamounia</a>- palace/ famous gardens</li><li><u>The Mellah</u><strong><em> &ndash;</em></strong> old Jewish quarter</li></ul></li><li>Things to Remember/ Summary</li><li><u>Background Information: </u>The name Marrakech originates from the Amazigh (Berber) wordsmur (n) akush, which means 'Land of God.' It is the third largest city in Morocco, after Casablanca and Rabat, and lies near the foothills of the snow-capped Atlas Mountains. It is a few hours from the foot of the Sahara Desert. Its location and contrasting landscape has made it an enviable destination in Morocco. The city is divided into two distinct parts: the Medina, the historical city, and the new European modern district called Gueliz or Ville Nouvelle. The Medina is full of intertwining narrow passageways and local shops full of character. In contrast, Gueliz plays host to modern restaurants, fast food chains and big brand stores.</li><li><u>Currency:</u> The Moroccan Dirham (DEE-rahm). It's been worth between 11&cent; and 13&cent; since about 2010, so it's a good bet's about 12&cent; per Dirham.</li><li><u>Language:</u> mixture of Arabic, Berber, English and French</li><li><u>Customs</u>: Women often dress VERY modestly in Moroccan culture. Wear airy flowy things that don't constrict but still cover the female form would be appropriate. Can buy clothing locally, which will also give you some fun souvenirs! We bought so much in Morocco and everything was so cheap!! Gotta by the flowy pants and headdress/scarf!!</li><li><u>Drugs/Partying Culture</u>: You can drink in Morocco but it is harder to find the places that deserve alcohol. We drank at a restraunt one night and they served very good/ cheap drinks. There are also many clubs in Marrakech but we didn&rsquo;t make it to one. Hashish is quite common in Morocco but we never smoked it.</li><li><u>Donts</u>: NOTHING IS FREE. If you hold anything or take a picture, they will charge you!! Also if someone offers to show you somewhere, they also will charge you!! That&rsquo;s why we had the guides in our hostel show us places. Don&rsquo;t forget a map of the city (most streets not named), wear sensible shoes, roads are cobbled and dirty. People are overly friendly, don&rsquo;t get too sucked into it (all about money). Taxis will always rip you off so insist on metre being turned on, be prepared to get constantly harassed so just smile and walk away. Do not pay more than 30-40 durhumans for taxis- they will rip you off . Spend your money! &ndash; dirham is closed currency so you can change it when you arrive but can&rsquo;t change it back on way out. Finally, Get to airport 2 hours before b/c Crazy lines!</li></ul><p><u>Conclusion:</u></p><ul><li>We flew into Casablanca because it was cheaper, spent a half day there, and then took a train to Marrakech. Seeing the mosque in Casablanca was absolutely insane but if I had to do it again I would just to a round trip to Marakesh because there is so much to see there. Also spending time in Casablanca provided us with a huge language barrier and figuring out the train to Marrakech was kinda struggle. We had to buy a ticket when we got there and didn&rsquo;t get a seat the first hour of out 3 hour train ride. But it was an adventure! When we arrived to Marrakech we ate dinner and explored the market. Saturday we did our dessert excursion, spa, and explored more of the market. Sunday we saw the gardens, mosques, and explored the market during the day time. We departed Sunday night. Marrakech was one of the coolest cities and I wish I could of spent more time here. Overall, In my opinion the people really &ldquo;make&rdquo; a country. Morocco was one of my favorite places because of all the friendly/ amazing people there were and how the culture was so open and warm. I also loved it because we were able to do sooo much in just one weekend, everything was hella cheap, and the weather was beautiful. I was so happy all weekend while I was here. It was just a completely new and different experience. You really felt like you were in another world.</li></ul><p>TAKEAWAY: Go to Morocco if you want to feel like you are in a completely different world with such a cool culture. Also go if you want to do adventurous activities and just get lost in a completely new city.</p>"),

We went Saturday and Tuesday night (the biggest night). Would highly recommend going. They had amazing parades and Stiges is this cute little beach town. Walk all around the streets, watch the parades, try to sneak on a float ..like we did:D, and go club hopping (the clubs are freakin weiiird/cool). Saturday we took a 16 euro train to Stiges and you pregame with everyone on the way there. For Tuesday would book it through Stokes Travel- for 25 euros we rode a bus to Stiges there in back and got a litre of Sangria for each person as we arrived. Company was so much fun and hilarious. Lastly, wear a costume!!</li></ul>"),

It was about a 15-minute walk from out hostel so we went about 3 times. Bring a bottle of wine with friends! Its super fun to chill and watch the sunset</li><li><u>Lake Thun</u> &ndash; about a 20-minute bus/train ride away. Also very beautiful and a lot bigger than Lake Brienz</li><li><u>Walk around Interlaken</u>- Very small/ can see a lot in a day</li><li><u>Paragliding </u>&ndash; would HIGHLY recommend paragliding. We really got to see the entire town from above, looking over and hanging over the Swiss alps for about 20 minutes. The wind was very good that day so we got very lucky. I would recommend booking it for Friday because if the weather ends up being bad that day you still can do it Saturday. Also, the guides are also super cool and will do tricks with you and they take go pro pictures. We had the option of brining out go pro too but I would recommend not- I liked being about enjoy it while he took the pictures. Overall, I absolutely loved it, so freakin beautiful..you are literally just chillin in the mountains.</li><li><u>Other Activities</u>: Bike Riding, Cable Car ride to the top, Cliff Jumping, Hand Gliding, Ice Climbing, Jung Fraeu Mountain, Motorinis, Skiing, Skydiving, Sun Decks. All these are great but I would recommend paragliding or bungee jumping. I was obsessed with paragliding and I also would recommend bungee jumping (it was just closed that weekend). But if you bungee jump, you don&rsquo;t see as much and it is very quick. I also would recommend skydiving but ONLY if you have never done it before. If you have already done it is not worth it (because of how expensive it is). My friend did it and loved it but keep in mind how expensive it is..around 500 euros and 100 euros for pictures.</li></ul><p>Food / Restaurants</p><ul><li><u>Export Pizza</u> &ndash; not what you think. I didn&rsquo;t want to eat pizza in Switzerland but they have a bunch of stuff on the menu. Get the DURHUM. Great Turkish food</li><li><u>Three Tells Irish Bar</u>- LOVED this place. It was a restaurant/bar and we had such great food. I had a hamburger and one of their cider beers, which I would recommend. Also super friendly atmosphere, our waiter was so nice</li><li><u>Swiss Chocolate</u> &ndash; ABSOLUTE must, you have to eat the chocolate and drink hot chocolate.</li><li><u>Cheese Fondue</u> &ndash; never tried this because it was 50 euros a person so don&rsquo;t know too much about it</li></ul><p>Night Life</p><ul><li><u>Balmers Hostel</u>- Super fun and there is a bar in the basement where all of the American students go at night. It is like being at a giant frat party. Great time!</li><li><u>Three Tells Irish Bar</u>- didn&rsquo;t go here at night but apparently was very fun</li></ul><p>Accommodation</p><ul><li><u>Youth Hostel</u> &ndash; we stayed in this hostel. Very clean and nice with cheap breakfasts and also in a perfect location.</li><li><u>Balmers Hostel</u> &ndash; we did not stay here but heard it was awesome. Its super cool looking from the outside and sure it is inside. They also have a basement club at the hostel that everyone goes too.</li><li><u>Backpackers Village</u></li></ul><p>Things to Remember/ Summary</p><ul><li>Interlaken is situated in between two lakes (brien and Thun) and is where its name derivers from &agrave; between two lakes. It is a thriving country/ super wealthy which makes it so expensive. A lot of their wealth comes from the banking since they don&rsquo;t have a lot of regulations .The people there are very peaceful and the town is super quaint. The people are some of the nicest I have ever met and just overwhelmingly friendly. The crime rate is a bare minimum and was a nice break from Barcelona where we have to watch for pickpocketers constantly. Interlaken is VERY small so you will be able to easily see most of the town.</li><li>Overall, Interlaken was one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. I have never seen anything like it, its just indescribable. Also one of the most expensive places I have ever been. A meal is around 17 euros so I recommend splitting all of your meals (they have really big portions), or bringing hella snacks. I also would recommend being rested before you leave. We did our trip through Bus2Alps and travelling was pretty exhausting having to fly into Geneva then take the bus to Interlaken.</li></ul><p>TAKEWAY: Go to Interlaken if you are interested in seeing some of the most beautiful sights, do adventurous activities like skiing/paragliding/skydiving and have chill nights.</p>"),

Also get food there- its so good! Would highly recommend going to the square at night. They have fire performers and always people singing/playing music. We got food from one of the food stands and just sat and listened forever.</li><li><u>Jewish Quarter: </u>there are a lot of different old synagogues and stands</li><li><u>Charles Bridge: </u>walk this, great views of the city and water</li><li><u>John Lennon Wall: </u>Near Charles Bridge, very cool and is changing constantly. People playing Beatles and John Lennon music, go when it is less crowded, can chill and listen to the music</li><li><u>Locks of Love: </u>Right past the Lennon Wall</li><li><u>Dancing House: </u>Built by Frank Gehry, restaurant on the top floor but pricey, just go see it.</li><li><u>Top of Hotel U Prince:</u> located in Old Town Square (one of the restaurants with heaters and outside seating areas)- this hotel also has a restaurant on top floor with, has great views with apparently ok food that we did not have. Get their signature drink but not food. Go for the dranks and da view</li><li><u>Prague Castle: </u>Walk around the whole castle and Climb to the top of the Castle (awesome views)</li><li><u>Beer Gardens : </u>they technically weren&rsquo;t open when we went but we basically went to the equivalent of one when we ate/drank at the Strahov Prague Castle Beer Monastery</li><li><u>Strahov Prague Castle Beer Monestary:</u> you HAVE to do this. We spent a good amount of time touring the Prague castle so then after we were looking around for a beer garden and then stumbled upon this place. It&rsquo;s an open space with a spectacular view of the whole city .The place is calm and quiet. I would suggest to go there after you have had a long day touring. The service is awesome, the food/beer was amazing, and the views were incredible.</li><li><u>Top of Prague Astronomical Clock: </u>every hour there is a show where little figures come out of the clock and such, cool to see, go to the top of the clock really pretty views of the city</li><li><u>Other Activities: </u></li></ul><p>Food/ Restaurants:</p><ul><li><u>Bakeshop</u>: on Dlouha street- great desserts, breads, bagels, pastries- pick up salads and sandwiches, AMAZING pumpkin soup!</li><li><u>Eating in Old Time Square </u><ul><li>Tredelnik- MUST, typical Prague food, stands everywhere</li><li>Goula Soup</li><li>Haluski- Potato with cabbage &amp; bacon, So warm/good</li><li>Old Prague Ham</li><li>Prague Sausage</li><li>BEER</li></ul></li></ul><p>Night Life:</p><ul><li><u>Lucerna:</u> Friday nights (and the best night of your life!!!) &ndash; all 80s and 90s music- be prepared to dance all night and sweat a lot and never want to leave&hellip; its very crowded but you will want to be dancing on stage and floor near stage &ndash; every person&rsquo;s favorite night, all visitors love it and everyone says it is among the top nights abroad (make sure to go to lucerna whenever you are in Prague for the weekend!!) concerts come here so keep and eye out, probably our favorite club</li><li><u>Drunken Monkey Pub Crawl: </u>SOOO much fun. We did it through our hostel, which made it cheaper and so fun to go out with everyone. Pub crawl consisted of 5 bars- only made it to 3 because we got too drunk but highly would recommend trying to make it to the fifth bar (Apparently it&rsquo;s a rooftop bar). The bars we went too had really cool vibes at each and were super underground/euro. For 15 euros we got unlimited beer, shots, abstinthe shots, the whole night. DO IT http://www.drunkenmonkey.cz</li></ul><p>Accommodation</p><ul><li><u>Mad House Prague Hostel: </u>The most fun hostel ever, you HAVE to stay here! It is located just 5-10 minutes from old two square- where essentially everything is. Mad House had one of the most welcoming/ friendly atmospheres. As soon as we got there we were greeted, showed around, and were given a free beer at our arrival. They gave us a lot of great information and invited us to all the events they had that weekend. They have free breakfast, coffee, and each night they had family dinners an then everyone pregame before we went out. Our second night we did the pub crawl which was one of my favorite nights in Europe. Overall, Everyone was so open to just meeting everyone and the people I met were so of the most interesting people. I felt 100% at home at this hostel and would go back in a heart beat. We stayed in a 10 person mixed room which was super nice and not once did I feel unsafe or uncomfortable. They have lockers in the room and safe places to keep your stuff. Pro Tip: if you stay here I would stay go with only 1-2 people max. They really emphasize meeting other people in this hostel and do not allow big groups to stay there. Pretty much everyone there but my friend and I were travelling alone and it was SOO COOL to hear their stories and their advice about &ldquo;how were doing it wrong and must travel alone&rdquo; Overall best hostel experience yet- my friend and I still talk about our stay. Wish we could of stayed longer!</li></ul><p>Things to Remember about Prague/ Summary:</p><ul><li>Prague is one of the most beautiful little cities. Everything was &ldquo;untouched&rdquo; rom the war so pretty much all the architecture and buildings are still standing. It is a quaint city with an enormous amount of history. I loved Prague because it was smaller so you really got a feel for the city in just two days. Everything is so European-esque, compared to Barcelona which is more modern. The nightlife was also a blast and they had a great mixture of really cool bar and clubs.</li></ul><p>TAKEWAY: You feel like you are in a fairty tale when you walk around Prague- I&rsquo;m not kidding! I also really loved it because it was iNSANELY cheap and we got to see SOO MUCH in just two days. Go to Prague to see amazing architecture, history, and a fun nightlife. One of my favorite cities and I believe it is a must to go too!</p>"),

Explore the East Side Gallery, a kilometer-long stretch of still-standing Wall, famous for its graffiti. It's politically charged and we give you plenty of time to soak it in, so don't forget your camera. Honestly one of my favrorite parts of Berlin- we picked up beers and then walked so much of the wall. It was amazinf seeing all the art and we had a great day</li><li><u>Berlin Bike Tour</u> - 26 euros for students, Day City Tour, departs 11am on Saturday and is four hours long, see about 13 sights and stop at a beer garden. DO THIS BIKE TOUR. Our guide was amazing and I literally learned so much!! <a href='http://berlin.fattirebiketours.com/tours/day-city-tour'>http://berlin.fattirebiketours.com/tours/day-city-tour</a></li><li><u>Checkpoint Charlie-</u> The famous border crossing between East Berlin and West Berlin for Allied forces and foreigners is now an outdoor exhibit detailing the Cold War.</li><li><u>Bradenburg Gate-</u> The Brandenburg Gate served as a backdrop for many of Berlin's most important events: Napoleon's march into Berlin, the division of Berlin during the Cold War, famous speeches (Reagan) and concerts (Hasselhof!), and much more.</li><li><u>Berlin Wall-</u> one of the last remaining sections of the Berlin Wall, now under historical protection, as we discussed why it was built and how it fell.</li><li><u>Hitlers Bunker-</u> Stand above Hitler's bunker as we recount the final days of the Third Reich and Hitler's bizarre demise.</li><li><u>Watchtower-</u> See one of the last remaining watchtowers in the Berlin Wall no-man's-land isolating West Berlin within East Germany.</li><li><u>Luftwafee</u>- The massive former headquarters building of the Nazi Luftwaffe Ministry still stands and is now the main building of Germany's Finance Ministry.</li><li><u>Victory Column</u> - This massive symbol of victory by the Prussian army over the Danes, Austrians, and French was relocated along the massive East-West Axis in accordance to Hitler's infamous redesign of Berlin.</li><li><u>Soviet War Memorial</u> - See the first of more than 500 war memorials the Soviets had built in former East Germany. This is the site of the first Soviet tanks to enter into Berlin in April 1945 as well as where 2500 fallen Soviet troops are buried.</li><li><u>Reichstag</u>- Germany's famous parliament building stood just in front of the Wall in West Berlin, a testament that the final chapters of Berlin's 20th Century history had yet to be written. Germany moved its federal government back to Berlin in 1999..</li><li><u>Museum Island-</u> This is home to five of Berlin's most famous museums, notably the Pergamon Museum and the Egyptian Museum (now housed in the Neues Museum).</li><li><u>Bebelplatz</u>- Directly in front of the main building and library of Germany's most prestigious university, this was the site of the Nazi's infamous book-burning on May 10, 1933.</li><li><u>Topography of Terror</u> - This former headquarters of the infamous Nazi 'Gestapo' and SS is now a free museum detailing interrogations by the Nazis that took place here.</li><li><u>Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe</u>- This recently-finished memorial is powerful to all who visit. Its 2711 blocks of various heights sit on undulating ground to give those walking through it a sense of solace and solitude.</li><li><u>Beer Garden Break -</u> About 2/3 through the tour we stop at a fantastic beer garden in the heart of Berlin's massive city park. This is a great chance to plug your guide for more inside information.</li></ul><p>Food/ Restaurants</p><ul><li>Currywurst</li><li>Any Durum Places!</li></ul><p>Night Life</p><ul><li><u>PUB Crawl</u>: book through hostel, do usually 4 bars then club. We did the anti pub-crawl which I woild not recommend. We went to really weird places and I would do a normal one. The only reason we did this is because it was through our hostel</li><li><u>Watergate</u>: guaranteed to get into club if go through pub crawl that is put on through Circus hostel (Friend this is). We didn&rsquo;t get in here because we weren&rsquo;t all 21. They usually don&rsquo;t card you but we looked touristy as hell so that&rsquo;s probably why they did. Don&rsquo;t look touristy!!</li><li><u>Berghain</u> - &ldquo;The best club in europe&rdquo; you go at 5 or 6am after going out. Hardest club in Europe to get into but supposed to be one of the most INSANE nights of your life. People stay in there for like 24 hour periods. Google it!&nbsp;&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t get in but it was worth a try.. but I wouldnt expect to get in:/</li></ul><p>Accommodation</p><ul><li><u>Wombats Hostel:</u> Great hostel, very friendly staff with a lot of great information. The rooftop terrace bar was also a lot of fun!</li><li><u>Circus Hostel:</u> friend stayed here, said it was awesome and had a great pub crawl</li></ul><p>Transportation</p><ul><li>From the airport take the train! When you land go to the tourist office where they will set you up with a train ticket and will give you directions.- take train to alexander place and switch onto metro u8 or u9 and get off after one stop.</li><li>Can not walk everywhere unfortunately so you will have to take the metro most places. We were told that they usually don&rsquo;t check if you have a train or metro card so we went everywhere without one until one evening these two policeman that were obviously pinpointing us asked us for our cards when we got off the metro. Kinda scary at the time, had to pay them off to let us go. Because of this I should advice you to actually buy a metro and train card but we had friends that went to Berlin and road for free the whole weekend..so do it at your disrection. Looking back though it was honestly such a funny experience</li><li>If you take taxis everywhere, BRING CASH- 99% of the taxis do not take card in Berlin</li></ul><p>Things I wish I could of done</p><ul><li><u>Mauerpark Flea Market</u> - GO. Its on sundays. Eat curryworst and strudel</li><li><u>Sachausen concentration camp</u> &ndash; a little further out of Berlin but really great to go too</li></ul><p>Things to Remember/ Summary</p><ul><li>A lot of people go to Berlin because it is apparently the &ldquo;partying/club capitol of the world.&rdquo; This is very true but going many people do not realize that it is IMPOSSIBLE to get into clubs there. You HAVE to fit the vibe of the club or they won&rsquo;t let you in. I suggest not going in huge groups, don&rsquo;t look American or speak English, if you can speak German that goes a long way, don&rsquo;t be obnoxious in line, wear black. Seriously google it Berlin clubs are hard to get into. But apparently if you do it&rsquo;s the best night of your life.</li></ul><p>TAKEAWAY: Go if you like HISTORY and clubbing</p>"),
