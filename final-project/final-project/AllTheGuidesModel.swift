My guide doesn&rsquo;t consist of everything single thing you can do in the city, but what I did and my main recommendations. I only had around 2 &frac12; months in Boston and wanted to spend my time wisely and have a general plan of things I wanted to do while there. That being said &ndash; some of the best experiences I had in Boston (and also travelling outside of it) we&rsquo;re not planned. Have a general plan and be smart with your time but also be SPONTANEOUS&hellip;some of the best experiences I had were the little things you just stumble upon. It is so much fun finding hidden treasures and having random/unplanned days. These are the days that you really really remember and learn so much about yourself. Boston really is such a fun and young city so take advantage of the melting pot of people and also the city as a whole. Meet the people, try everything, and walk around for hours. Boston really has such character that I have yet to find anywhere else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Key Lessons</strong></p><ul><li><u>STEP OUT of your comfort zone</u>- I moved to Boston knowing one person and lived with completely random girls I found on a sublease page and it was the best decision I could of done. It is important to branch out and MEET OTHER PEOPLE.</li><li><u>CHERISH the beauty of living a new city</u>- make sure you appreciate every second of living in a completely different city. Take a step back and take it in- it goes by way too fast</li><li><u>Learn the PEOPLE</u> &ndash; people in the east coast can be different. Make sure you take the time to learn the people. Also people from Boston have a HUGE amount of pride. Make sure you immerse yourself in that</li><li><u>Get LOST on purpose</u> &ndash; this how you stumble upon the hidden gems</li><li><u>Enjoy the JOURNEY not the destination</u> - I met the most incredible people literally on transportation. Remember the best things about some of the places you&rsquo;ll be going happens in route</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sights/ Things to do </strong></p><ul><li><u>Top of the Hub/ Prudential Center</u> &ndash; 360 view of the whole city<ul><li>Skywalk observatory &ndash; view of entire city, 19 dollars entrance, closes at 10pm: http://www.prudentialcenter.com/shop_detail.html?id=64</li><li>Top of the Hub-Restaurant - 52<sup>nd</sup> floor, expensive, good for a drink</li></ul></li><li><u>Boston Common</u> &ndash; walk/run/chill here, free workout classes (Boston power hour), swan boat tours</li><li><u>Faneuil Hall/ Quincy Market</u> - big building located in downtown Boston near the bay area.
